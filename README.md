# Flappy-Bird
Hello, This is the repo of me regarding the flappy bird scratch project.
As you guys know, this is Scratch and so there won't be any code.
However, you can always check out my project on Scratch as it is shared.
In there, you can also click on the see inside button and see my block code.
Here is the link to the scratch project: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/389589663/.
And if you want to see my youtube video about the scratch project more in depth, then you can check out this link which is my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWAT2pkDZs

Happy Coding!
